# Bandit

  id: ClothingOuterJacketBandit
  name: bandit jacket
  description: The black leather jacket is a traditional attribute of bandits. Unlike the jackets worn by newbies, this one has thin metal plates sewn into it that can slightly protect against pistol rounds. It is clear that it will not withstand anomalies and machine gun fire, but in a skirmish with some newbie it can be of great help.
