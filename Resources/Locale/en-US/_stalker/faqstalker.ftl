        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Dear Readers,

           Stalking is not just a profession; it's a way of life. It’s a world where every step could be decisive, and every decision a matter of life and death. Within the grim expanses of the Zone, you can find everything: friends and foes, wealth and poverty, mysteries and dangers.

           This book is not just a manual or a guide; it’s a collection of rules and advice that will help you survive in this perilous world. Here, you will find not only survival tips but also stories of what awaits you in the farthest corners of the Zone, the secrets it holds, and the trials you’ll have to endure.

         Strength lies in knowledge, strength lies in weapons, strength lies within you, Stalker!

          Sincerely, Nikolai Khurmenko and
          the IC News Office

                                    Stash and Purgatory

          Purgatory is where your journey always begins. You have two options: head to the village or the Pre-Zone. To reach the village, enter the right passage (marked with the Stalker patch). Walk through, and you'll find yourself in the village.
          Below, there's a passage to the Pre-Zone. To the left is a passage to the "shop," which contains the stash. On the right, there's a passage to the "hospital." Exit the hospital and head up until you reach the crosswalk (the one with two stripes). Then, turn right and continue upward. You'll find the shop on your left and the stash passage on your right.
          The last passage, located in the middle, is called the "station." Once there, exit the station and follow the road to the right. Afterward, find the hospital and head upward to the first crosswalk. From there, turn right and continue upward.


          Now you've arrived in the city of Chernobyl-4. And the question arises: "What should I do next?"
          First, I suggest familiarizing yourself with your residence—the Stash.
          The stash has everything you need for living: a bathroom, a bedroom, and most importantly—a blue vending machine.
          It’s the only thing that will keep your belongings safe and sound. But there’s a small catch: you can’t just shove things into it. The machine has a button marked "E." Press it, and then you can store your items.

         The bathroom includes a sink, although it’s empty (thanks, Mayor). And, of course, humanity’s greatest invention—the toilet. Meanwhile, in the bedroom, you can get some much-needed rest.

                                     Chernobyl-4

         Chernobyl-4 is a city adjacent to the Chernobyl Anomalous Zone. It is home to civilians, military personnel, and stalkers.
         The city is small, and you can explore it in about 3-4 minutes. I recommend spending an hour or two familiarizing yourself with the city. Here's a valuable tip: don’t flaunt your faction patch in the city—law enforcement will definitely have a few questions for you.

                                        Earnings

         After arriving in the city, you’ll likely have around 2,000 rubles left. There are several ways to earn money.
         First, you can work as a loader, carrying crates from the station to the market. Or you could collect bottles and sell them to the bum Petrukha. But I’m guessing you didn’t come to the Zone just to carry crates!

            Now, let’s discuss how to earn money by venturing into the Zone. The next chapter will cover where to go and what to bring.
            There are many ways to earn in the Zone, but each comes with its risks and challenges. Let’s explore a few of them:

        1. Stalker Expeditions: One of the main ways to earn in the Zone is by venturing into its most dangerous corners to collect artifacts or complete client missions. Successful missions can yield generous rewards.

        2. Trading: Stalkers can trade found artifacts, as well as weapons, ammunition, and other valuable items. The best buyers are scientists from the Research Institute, especially for mutant trophies and artifacts. But beware—the military may search you. Stay cautious!

        3. Smuggling: Some stalkers engage in smuggling, transporting forbidden or rare items within the Zone. It’s risky but profitable. You can buy contraband from the Trader and sell it to Sidorovich in the Rookie Village.

        4.Mercenary Work: Various factions and organizations hire stalkers for tasks such as guarding or eliminating rivals. This can be a reliable source of income but often involves dangerous assignments. (See appendix for more on these factions.)

        5.Equipment Repair and Upgrades: Repair masters can earn money by restoring and upgrading weapons, armor, and other gear for fellow stalkers.

                                          The Zone

         The Zone has attracted adventurers from around the world for decades! However, many people arrive without fully considering the dangers they’ll face. Countless lives have been lost to anomalies and local wildlife. Why? Because they ventured into the Zone without proper equipment. We aim to fix that.

          Here are some tips to avoid dying in the Zone:

        1. Travel in Groups: You might handle one or two blind dogs alone, but what if there are three or four? Until you gain experience, always travel in groups for backup.

        2. Carry Bolts: Anomalies can be anywhere. Bolts make a sound when thrown, helping you detect anomalies with near certainty.

        3. Radiation Dosimeter: Keep a dosimeter in your pocket. Some areas have radiation levels exceeding 4 Sieverts! Without a dosimeter, you might not even realize you’re in a radiation zone.

        4. Shotguns for Mutants: A shotgun with buckshot works best against mutants. However, for deadlier creatures, you’ll need an automatic rifle with high-grade ammo. These monsters lurk in the northern Zone, so you’re safe from them near the Cordon or swamps.

        5. Carry a Knife: How else will you cut through bushes or collect mutant trophies?

        6. Medical Supplies: Always have medical supplies. A bandage, two bruise kits, and a Dexalin tablet are essentials. Pricier options include AI-2 kits and military medkits.

        7. Proper Gear: Don’t enter the Zone unprepared. Start with a Zorya suit and a SSH-68 helmet. If you’re hunting artifacts, wear an SSP Ecologist or SEVA suit, along with a gas mask. Don’t forget your artifact detector! For firefights, you’ll need a bulletproof vest and a helmet. Bring Tier 2 or Tier 3 ammo for those situations.
